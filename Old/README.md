# Winkys-Divinator
All the stuff for Winky's Divinator - an online DnD 5e duel simulator.

Update - 12-02-2019
There are intended to be several different modes:
1. Goblin Stream: send an endless stream of goblins at a character and see how long they last.
2. Single Duel: Get two characters to fighht until one reaches 0HP. Output each action and roll.
3. Many duels: Get results of many duels to see which character is more likely to win.

I expect that eventually there will be a single index page and probably a different page for each game mode.
How much of the work is done in javascript compared to ruby/python has not yet been determined.
